## Tasks

**Minimum Operations**
In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

* Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`
* Returns an integer
* If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0` 

**Example:**

`n = 9`
`H` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HH` => `Paste` => `HHH` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HHHHHH` => `Paste` => `HHHHHHHHH`
* Number of operations: `6`
