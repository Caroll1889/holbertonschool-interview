## Tasks

**Rain**

Given a list of non-negative integers representing walls of width 1, calculate how much water will be retained after it rains.

* Prototype: `def rain(walls)`
* `walls` is a list of non-negative integers.
* Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
* Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.
* If the list is empty return `0`.
