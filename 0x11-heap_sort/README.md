# 0x11. Heap Sort
### :open_file_folder: Specializations - Interview Preparation ― Algorithms

## Tasks

**Heap sort**

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

* Prototype: `void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
* You must implement the `sift-down` heap sort algorithm
* You’re expected to print the `array` after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the [Heap sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort) algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
