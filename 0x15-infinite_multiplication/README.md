## Tasks

**Infinite Multiplication**

Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers:

* Usage: `mul num1 num2`
* `num1` and `num2` will be passed in base 10
* Print the result, followed by a new line
* If the number of arguments is incorrect, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of `98`
* `num1` and `num2` should only be composed of digits. If not, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of `98`
* You are allowed to use more than 5 functions in your file

You can use `bc (man bc)` to check your results.
